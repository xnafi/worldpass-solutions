              <p className="mt-4 text-white/60">
                Our journey began in 2010 with a small coffee shop in the heart
                of the city. Over the years, we have grown into a community
                favorite, known for our exceptional coffee, friendly staff, and
                inviting atmosphere.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4 text-white/60">
                We source our beans from the finest coffee-growing regions
                around the world and roast them to perfection to bring out their
                unique flavors. Whether you are a coffee aficionado or just
                looking for a cozy place to relax, Cappuccino is the perfect
                spot.
